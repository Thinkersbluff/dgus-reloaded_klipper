Last Updated:  20 Nov 24
New at release 1.3.4 (version # 1.2.9 not used)

  - Added support for DWIN_SET v 0.4.3
    - Corrected scroll_index logic:
      - Defines central ("3rd" position in the list) as position 0. 
      - Uses negative indices (-1, -2) to define the positions of the last two files
      - Uses positive indices (1, 2) to define the two less recent files
    - Implemented a function to delete the selected file from the Virtual SD Card.
      - Includes an "Are your sure?" popup to Confirm or Cancel the request.

  - No Change to Related Changes files
    To install this version of the Klipper component, you need only replace the t5uid1 folder 
    and its contents on your Klipper host and then reboot the host.
     
Known Issues at this Release:
 - The filelist, scroll and delete file scripts expect your gcode files to be stored in the default Klipper Virtual SD card directory:  ~/printer_data/gcodes
  - If your gcodes are stored in a different directory, they may not work for you
 - I use long filenames, so I designed the list to capture all of the .gcode files in all subfolders, but to NOT display the subfolder names in the list 
  - If you use subfolders to store different versions of files with the same name, you may not like this list.
