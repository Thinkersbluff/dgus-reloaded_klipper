Last Updated:  16 Nov 24
New at release 1.3.3 (version # 1.2.9 not used)

  - Added support for DWIN_SET v 0.4.2
    - Modified Print Time Remaining logic:
      - Captures the first Rx value and sets those minutes as the initial time Remaining
      - Subtracts Print Time Elapsed from Initial Time Remaining, to make Print Time Remaining into a count-down timer, until it reaches zero
      - If still printing when Print Time Remaining counts down to zero, reverts to displaying the Rx values received, until the print ends.
    - Implemented a scrollable list of the .gcode files on the Virtual SD Card, with the ability to print whichever file is highlighted

  - Solved Issue#8 which prevented printing files which were stored in subfolders of ~/printer_data/gcodes/. 
    - Useful at v1.3.2 but modifies a macro which is made obsolete at this release

  - Updated Related Changes files
    - Cura has redacted and replaced the recommended plug-ins for M73 and the Current Layer/Total Layers M117 info.  This release updates that guidance.
 
 - Did NOT implement the solution to Issue#8 or delete the Repeat Last Print macros
    - The solution to Issue#8 was to modify one line in a macro in DGUS-Reloaded.cfg.  
    - That macro is no longer used as of this release, so I have not incorporated that change
    - The Repeat Last Print scripts have been left in the configuration files at this release, rather than risk introducing a bug by simply deleting them.
      - I may remove them at a subsequent release, when I have time to test for any inadvertent bugs that their deletion may introduce.
    
Known Issues at this Release:
 - The new scripts expect your gcode files to be stored in the default Klipper Virtual SD card directory:  ~/printer_data/gcodes
  - If your gcodes are stored in a different directory, they may not work for you
 - I use long filenames, so I designed the list to capture all of the .gcode files in all subfolders, but to NOT display the subfolder names in the list 
  - If you use subfolders to store different versions of files with the same name, you may not like this list.
