Last Updated:  22 Dec 24
New at release 1.3.5

  - Added support for DWIN_SET v 0.4.4
    - Provide the information displayed on the Information page
	- Includes adding a tag to the current version of dgus_reloaded

  - Fixed Issue#47, by running M220 S100 and M221 S100 before switching to the print finished screen.
	- Provides an opportunity to visually ensure that those two factors have been reset, before exiting the print_finished screen, and removes the risk that a user will forget to reset those two parameters after a print.

  - Updated the Related Changes files
    - Removed guidelines related to tailoring KIAUH.  
      - Only recommend using the Raspi Imager to make a clean install of Mainsail OS and Klipper.
    - Updated all Readme.txt files, to remove some out-dated instructions and clarify others.

     
Known Issues at this Release: (No changes since v1.3.4)
 - The filelist, scroll and delete file scripts expect your gcode files to be stored in the default Klipper Virtual SD card directory:  ~/printer_data/gcodes. If your gcodes are stored in a different directory, they may not work for you
 - I use long filenames, so I designed the list to capture all of the .gcode files in all subfolders, but to NOT display the subfolder names in the list 
  - If you use subfolders to store different versions of files with the same name, you may not like this list.
