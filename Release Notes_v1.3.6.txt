Last Updated:  3 Jan 25
New at release 1.3.6


New/Modified Features:

 - Modified the scripts by which Print Time Remaining was calculated, to make it more closely track Slicer-Estimated Print Time Remaining (using M73 Rx messages from the slicer.)
   - If the M73 R value is lower than the current estimated time remaining, estimated time remaining is now reset to the M73 value
   - BUT: If the M73 R value is actually higher than the current estimated time remaining, the estimated time is NOT reset to align with that, unless and until that estimate runs down to zero.

     
Known Issues at this Release: (No changes since v1.3.4)
 - The filelist, scroll and delete file scripts expect your gcode files to be stored in the default Klipper Virtual SD card directory:  ~/printer_data/gcodes. If your gcodes are stored in a different directory, they may not work for you
 - I use long filenames, so I designed the list to capture all of the .gcode files in all subfolders, but to NOT display the subfolder names in the list 
  - If you use subfolders to store different versions of files with the same name, you may not like this list.
